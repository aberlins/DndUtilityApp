My mentor gave me a journal filled with lore and wisdom. Losing it would devastate me.
Having lived among the people of a primeval tribe or clan, I long to return and see how they are faring.
Years ago, tragedy struck the members of an isolated society I befriended, and I will honor them.
I want to learn more about a particular humanoid culture that fascinates me.
I seek to avenge a clan, tribe, kingdom, or empire that was wiped out.
I have a trinket that I believe is the key to finding a long-lost society.
