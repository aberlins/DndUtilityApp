I have trouble trusting people I've just met.
I enjoy the open road. Underground and tight spaces make me very nervous.
I expect others to heed my orders and have little respect or sympathy if they don't.
I am very prideful and have trouble admitting when I'm wrong.
Once I decide on a course of action, I do not waiver.
I like to explore, and my curiosity will sometimes get me into trouble.
