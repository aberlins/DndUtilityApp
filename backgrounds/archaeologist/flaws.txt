I have a secret fear of some common wild animal – and in my work, I see them everywhere.
I can't leave a room without searching it for secret doors.
When I'm not exploring dungeons or ruins, I get jittery and impatient.
I have no time for friends or family. I spend every waking moment thinking about and preparing for my next expedition.
When given the choice of going left or right, I always go left.
I can't sleep except in total darkness.
