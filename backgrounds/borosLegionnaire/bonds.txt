I would lay down my life for Aurelia and the angels.
I owe my life to the Boros captain who took me in when I was living on the streets.
My fellow legionnaires are my family.
I wield the same Boros weapon my grandparent did, for the honor of our family.
I ran with the Rakdos in my youth, and I'm striving to atone for my past misdeeds.
I do what I can to help out the spouse of a comrade who died in battle.
