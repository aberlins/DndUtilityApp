Ever since I was a child, I've heard stories about a lost city. I aim to find it, learn its secrets, and earn my place in the history books.
I want to find my mentor, who disappeared on an expedition some time ago.
I have a friendly rival. Only one of us can be the best, and I aim to prove it's me.
I won't sell an art object or other treasure that has historical significance or is one of a kind.
I'm secretly in love with the wealthy patron who sponsors my archaeological exploits.
I hope to bring prestige to a library, a museum, or a university.
