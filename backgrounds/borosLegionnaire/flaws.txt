I act bravely when I'm in a group, but I'm a coward when I'm alone.
I see everything in clear-cut black and white.
I'm just a little fascinated by the ways of the Gruul.
I trust the chain of command more than anything - more even than my closest friends.
I'm slow to trust members of other guilds.
I've been known to turn a blind eye to injustice, with the help of a modest bribe.
