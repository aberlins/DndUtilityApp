While my parent was out adventuring, a servant raised me, and I care about that person more than anyone.
I consider every member of my parent's former adventuring party to be family.
Despite their absences, my famous parent was kind and generous. I love them and want to make them proud.
My parent once brought a cursed magic item home. It is my obsession.
My childhood home holds all my best memories, and its upkeep is my primary concern.
Growing up, I had an imaginary friend I could always count on. That friend is still with me.
