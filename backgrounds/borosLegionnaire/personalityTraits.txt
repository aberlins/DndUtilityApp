I approach every task with the same high degree of military precision.
I am always the first into the fray.
I bear any injury or indignity with stoic discipline.
My righteous wrath is easily inflamed by the slightest iniquity.
My honor is more important to me than my life.
Dangerous work is best accomplished by an orderly group working with common purpose.
I treat my weapon, uniform, and insignia with reverence, for they are gifts of the angels.
I pace when standing and fidget incessantly when forced to sit.
