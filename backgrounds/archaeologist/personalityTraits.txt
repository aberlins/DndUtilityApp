I love a good puzzle or mystery.
I'm a pack rat who never throws anything away.
Fame is more important to me than money.
I have no qualms about stealing from the dead.
I'm happier in a dusty old tomb than I am in the centers of civilization.
Traps don't make me nervous. Idiots who trigger traps make me nervous.
I might fail, but I will never give up.
You might think I'm a scholar, but I love a good brawl. These fists were made for punching.
