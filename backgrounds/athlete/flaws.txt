I indulge in a habit that threatens my reputation or health.
I'll do absolutely anything to win.
I ignore anyone who doesn't compete and anyone who loses to me.
I have lingering pain of old injuries.
Any defeat or failure on my part is because my opponents cheated.
I must be the captain of any group I join.
