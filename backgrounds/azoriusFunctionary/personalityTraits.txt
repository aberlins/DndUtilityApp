I try never to let my judgment become clouded by emotion.
I have infinite patience with the dolts and boors I'm forced to deal with every day.
When I give an order, I expect it to be obeyed.
I just want things the way I like them: neat, orderly, and clean.
No wrongdoing can escape my watchful gaze.
I always say exactly what I mean, no matter how many words it takes to communicate the particular nuance I am attempting to convey.
I'm very literal and don't appreciate metaphor or sarcasm.
I never change my mind once it's made up.
