I will never get out of my famous parent's shadow, and no one else will ever understand this burden.
I've seen enough of the adventuring life to have realistic expectations and empathy for my peers.
Living up to my legacy will be difficult, but I'm going to do it.
I'm used to the very best in life, and that's a hard habit to break.
My parent taught me a sense of duty. I strive to uphold it, even when the odds are against me.
No one can fake a smile, a handshake, or an interested nod like I can.
I've been part of the adventuring life since I was old enough to walk. Let me explain a few things to you.
No risk is too great for the rewards of defeating my enemies... and taking their stuff.
