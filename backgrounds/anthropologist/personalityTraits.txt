I prefer the company of those who aren't like me, including people of other races.
I'm a stickler when it comes to observing proper etiquette and local customs.
I would rather observe than meddle.
By living among violent people, I have become desensitized to violence.
I would risk life and limb to discover a new culture or unravel the secrets of a dead one.
When I arrive at a new settlement for the first time, I must learn all its customs.
