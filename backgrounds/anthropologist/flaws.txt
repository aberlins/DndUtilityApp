Boats make me seasick.
I talk to myself, and I don't make friends easily.
I believe that I'm intellectually superior to people from other cultures and have much to teach them.
I've picked up some unpleasant habits living among races such as goblins, lizardfolk, or orcs.
I complain about everything.
I wear a tribal mask and never take it off.
