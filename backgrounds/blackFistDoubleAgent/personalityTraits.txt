People are only as trustworthy as you are valuable to them. Always strive to be the most valuable person around.
My eloquence and sophistication are tools I use to avoid arousing suspicion myself.
I am a thrill-seeker, excited by covert and dangerous missions.
I live by my wits and always check every lock twice, just to be certain.
I never admit to my mistakes lest they be used against me. 
I take every effort to be unnoticeable and blend into the crowd. Passersby rarely give me a second look.
I am prepared for any eventuality; including the day my usefulness as a spy comes to an end.
I always make certain to know my enemy before acting, lest I bite off more than I can chew.
