I'm unable to distinguish between the letter and the spirit of the law.
I seem like a harsh judge to others, but I judge myself most harshly of all.
I have a secret, illegal vice.
I was traumatized by witnessing a crime as a child.
I'm incapable of deception.
I wish I had joined the Boros, but I fear they'd never accept me.
