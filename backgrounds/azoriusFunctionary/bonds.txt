I am beholden to an Azorius arrester who captured the criminal who killed my parents, saving me from the same fate.
I hope one day to write the laws, not just enforce them.
I tried and failed to prevent a murder, and I have sworn to find and arrest the perpetrator.
I successfully prevented a murder, and the would-be perpetrator wants me dead.
One of my parents was prominent in the guild, and I resent constantly being compared to that standard
I've modeled my career after a highly respected lawmage or arrester, but I fear that my role model might be involved in something illegal.
