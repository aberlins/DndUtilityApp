I feel most at peace during physical exertion, whether exercise or battle.
I don't like to sit idle.
I have a daily exercise routine I refuse to break.
Obstacles exist to be overcome.
When I see others struggling, I offer to help.
I love to trade banter and gibes.
Anything worth doing is worth doing best.
I get irritated if people praise someone else and not me.
