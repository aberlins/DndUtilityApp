I think too highly of myself, and have an exaggerated sense of self-importance.
I have difficulty trusting strangers. I see spies and informants everywhere.
Years of getting away with minor crimes has left me believing that I am above the law, and have diplomatic immunity above my station.
Years of seeing innocent people suffer have left me despondent and pessimistic for the future.
My desire for vengeance often gets me into trouble.
I am spendthrift, and share my wealth with the patrons of my favorite tavern.
